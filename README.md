# DatabaseTechnologies
Database Technologies course projects. The first consisted in having the dellstore dataset in SQL to which we made up some complex
operations/queries (Phase 0 and 1) that would suite a business scenario. We also had to deal with concurrency (Phase 2) and Optimization with indexes (Phase 3)

The second project consisted in getting some dataset we choose one about a TV Show 'How I met your mother' and we imported that into Neo4j and made some queries
to analyse the data.
